                <p class="text-black">The hoolock gibbons are three primate species of genus Hoolock in the gibbon family, Hylobatidae, native to eastern Bangladesh, Northeast India, Myanmar, and Southwest China.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>Hoolocks are the second-largest of the gibbons, after the siamang. They reach a size of 60 to 90 cm and weigh 6 to 9 kg. The sexes are about the same size, but they differ considerably in coloration; males are black-colored with remarkable white brows, while females have a grey-brown fur, which is darker at the chest and neck. White rings around their eyes and mouths give their faces a mask-like appearance. The Oxford English Dictionary says that the name "hoolock" is from "a language of Assam."</p>
                <p>In northeast India, the hoolock is found south of Brahmaputra and the North Bank areas and east of the Dibang Rivers.[4] Its range extends into seven states covering Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura (The seven northeastern states of India).[5][6] In Bangladesh, the western hoolock gibbons were distributed across 35 forest fragments. The largest of these (Lawachara and Kaptai) supported 42 and 84 individuals respectively, but 17 of the fragments had less than ten individuals. For a better overview the forest fragments are grouped into 13 areas. All areas are located within Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, mostly near the eastern border of the country. In China, in historical times, the skywalker gibbon was recorded in nine counties in the west bank of the Salween River in westernmost Yunnan province. Based on more recent interview surveys conducted in Oct-Nov 2008 and field surveys conducted in Mar, Apr, and Aug 2009, the current Chinese population of hoolock gibbons was found to be restricted to three counties (Baoshan, Tengchong, and Yingjiang). The population size was estimated to be less than 200 individuals. In Myanmar, all three species of hoolock gibbon can be found in the forested areas west of Thanlwin river. Of all four distribution countries, Myanmar holds the key population of all three species. </p>
                <p>Like the other gibbons, they are diurnal and arboreal, brachiating through the trees with their long arms. They live together in monogamous pairs, which stake out a territory. Their calls serve to locate family members and ward off other gibbons from their territory. Their diet consists mainly of fruits, insects and leaves.</p>
