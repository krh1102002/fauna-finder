                <p class="text-black" style="text-align:justify ;">TSalamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by their lizard-like appearance. Salamanders rarely have more than four toes on their front legs and five on their rear legs, but some species have fewer digits and others lack hind limbs. Salamanders typically lay eggs in water and have aquatic larvae, but great variation occurs in their lifecycles. They are generally not restricted to specific foods, but feed on almost any organism of a reasonable size. Members of the family Salamandridae are mostly known as newts and lack the costal grooves along the sides of their bodies typical of other groups. The skin of some species contains the powerful poison tetrodotoxin; these salamanders tend to be slow-moving and have bright warning coloration to advertise their toxicity. The skin lacks scales and is moist and smooth to the touch, except in newts of the Salamandridae, which may have velvety or warty skin, wet to the touch. .</p>
