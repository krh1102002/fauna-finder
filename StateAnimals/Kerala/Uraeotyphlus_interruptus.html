                <p class="text-black">Uraeotyphlus interruptus, also known as the Chengalam caecilian, is a species of caecilian in the
                    family Ichthyophiidae. It is endemic to the Western Ghats in southern India and is only known from
                    its type locality, Chengalam village in Kerala.</p>

                <p>Uraeotyphlus interruptus is a medium-sized caecilian measuring 185 mm (7.3 in) in length. The body
                    has 162 folds. The primary annuli cross the dorsum only on the posterior half and venter only in
                    front of the vent. The collar region is slightly wider than the head; the two collars are completely
                    fused dorsally but are distinct ventrally. The eyes are distinct. The ventral tentacle lies below the
                    nostril. Colouration is slaty violet above, slightly lighter below. The body folds are marked by white
                    lines that are more conspicuous on the posterior ventral one-third of the body.
                    </p>
                <p>Uraeotyphlus interruptus is a subterranean (fossorial) species associated with loose soil. The type
                    series was collected in a rubber plantation at an elevation of 400 m (1,300 ft) above sea level;
                    presumably, the natural habitat of this species is moist evergreen forest. It is probably oviparous
                    with terrestrial eggs and aquatic larvae living in streams.
                    </p>
                <p>Specific threats to this species are unknown. However, it clearly is somewhat adaptable, and as such
                    might not face significant threat from habitat change. It is not known to occur in any protected
                    areas.</p>
