                <p class="text-black">The Palani laughingthrush (Montecincla fairbanki) is a species of laughingthrush endemic to the hills
                    of the Western Ghats south of the Palghat Gap in Southern India</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>Found in the high montane forests,
                    this grey bibbed, rufous bellied bird with a prominent dark eyestripe and broad white brow was
                    grouped along with the grey-breasted subspecies of the black-chinned laughingthrush and known as
                    the grey-breasted laughingthrush. This species is found in the Palni Hills while another closely related form, the Ashambu laughingthrush (Montecincla meridionalis) with a shorter white brow is
                    found in the high hills south of the Achankovil Gap and was treated as a subspecies. The two forms
                    were together treated under the name of Kerala laughingthrush.</p>
                <p>This species has a dark grey-brown crown and narrow dark grey eyestripe with a broad white
                    supercilium above it. This supercilium extends behind the eye in this species but stops above the eye
                    in the closely related meridionalis. The throat is distinctly grey unlike in the black-chinned
                    laughingthrush found north of the Palghat Gap and continues into the upper breast</p>
                <p>The grey of the
                    upper breast is faintly streaked in brown. The lower breast and belly is rusty brown and the upper
                    parts are olive brown. The bill is browner and not as dark grey as in the black-chinned. The Ashambu
                    laughingthrush (M. meridionalis) which was earlier treated as a subspecies has greyer upper
                    plumage, paler crown and the centre of the belly is white with chestnut brown on the flanks and
                    vent. The iris is dark red or red-brown. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field.</p>
