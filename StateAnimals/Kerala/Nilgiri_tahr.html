                <p class="text-black">The Nilgiri tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius) is an ungulate that is endemic to the Nilgiri Hills and the
                    southern portion of the Western and Eastern Ghats in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in
                    southern India.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>It is the state animal of Tamil Nadu. Despite its local name, it is more closely related
                    to the sheep of the genus Ovis than the ibex and wild goats of the genus Capra. It is the only species
                    in the genus Nilgiritragus.</p>
                <p>The Nilgiri tahr is a stocky goat with short, coarse fur and a bristly mane. Males are larger than
                    females and of darker colour when mature. Both sexes have curved horns, reaching up to 40 cm
                    (16 in) for males and 30 cm (12 in) for females. Adult males weigh 80 to 100 kg (180 to 220 lb) and
                    stand about 100 cm (39 in) tall at the shoulder. Adult males develop a light grey area on their backs,
                    thus are called "saddlebacks"</p>
                <p>The Nilgiri tahr can be found only in India. It inhabits the open montane grassland habitat of
                    the South Western Ghats montane rain forests ecoregion. At elevations from 1,200 to 2,600 m
                    (3,900 to 8,500 ft), the forests open into large grasslands interspersed with pockets of stunted
                    forests, locally known as sholas. These grassland habitats are surrounded by dense forests at the
                    lower elevations. The Nilgiri tahrs formerly ranged over these grasslands in large herds, but hunting
                    and poaching in the 19th century reduced their population.</p>
