                <p>The black colored pig is regarded as an endangered species. The Ankamali pig of kerala is indigenous
                    to India and found in Kerala. Under genetic characterization and DNA samples of local pigs including
                    the large white pigs, no genetic closeness was found.</p>
                <p>The pig is known to scavenge for food which affected its appeal to the local community. Only a
                    handful of local farmers breed the pig in captivity. This led to the rapid decline of the species</p>
                <p>They have gradually made a recovery in recent times and highly prized for its pork attracting
                    premium price in the local market. Luckily there are a few cons</p>
