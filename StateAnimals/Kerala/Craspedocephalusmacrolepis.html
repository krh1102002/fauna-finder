                <p class="text-black">Craspedocephalus macrolepis, commonly known as the large-scaled pit viper is
                    a venomous pitviper species endemic to the Southern Western Ghats of South
                    India. No subspecies are currently recognized.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p>Dorsally, C. macrolepis is bright green, with blackish skin between the scales in some places. There is
                    a yellow or white stripe on each side of the body, which runs along the first dorsal scale row. The
                    upper lips are pale green, and there may be a black streak behind the eye.</p>
                <p>Ventrally, it is, which are
                    large, keeled, and overlapping, are arranged in only 12-15 rows at midbody. The dorsal scales in the
                    10 middle rows are always the largest, and additional rows are made up of smaller scales.</p>
                <p>An even
                    number of dorsal scale rows is frequently found in this species, even though it is uncommon in
                    snakes in general. Ventrals 133–143; subcaudals divided 44–58.</p>
                <p>The scales on the top of the head are very large, smooth, and overlapping. There is an elongate
                    subocular, which is separated from the upper labials by a row of a few small scales. There are 7-8
                    upper labials, of which the 3rd is the largest.</p>
                <p>It is both terrestrial and arboreal, using its prehensile tail to hold onto branches. It is
                        an ambush hunting snake relying on its camouflage to catch prey. The heat-sensing loreal pits are
                        used to locate warm-blooded prey.</p>
