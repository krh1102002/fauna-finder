                <p>Adult males measure 15–15.7 mm (0.59–0.62 in) in snout–vent length; no females were collected.
                    The overall appearance is relatively slender. The snout is subovoid in dorsal view and rounded in
                    lateral view. The tympanum is indistinct and the supratympanic fold is weakly developed. The limbs
                    are short.</p>
                <p>The finger tips are slightly expanded but lack grooves; dermal fringes are weakly
                    developed and webbing is absent. The toe tips are rounded and slightly enlarged into discs with
                    prominent dorsoterminal grooves; dermal fringes are well developed. The dorsum, upper eyelids,
                    and lateral surfaces of snout are greyish-brown with scattered light brown markings dorsum and
                    snout. The lateral surfaces of head are light greyish-brown and bear minute light brown spots. There
                    are prominent brown crossbands on the lips.</p>
                <p>The sides of the body are greyish-brown with a dark
                    blackish-brown band, marking, or skin fold starting from tip of the nostril and running towards the
                    groin. The limbs are light greyish-brown with brown transverse bands; webbing light brown. The
                    anterior parts of thighs are light yellowish-brown with faint grey spots. The throat is light flesh color
                    with minute dark speckles.</p>
                <p>Microhyla darreli has been found inside a wayside plantation area close to a river (the type locality,
                    21 m (69 ft) asl) and adjacent to a temporary pool inside a plantation. It was observed to be locally
                    abundant during its short breeding season in June–July. As of early 2021, this species has not yet
                    been included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.</p>
