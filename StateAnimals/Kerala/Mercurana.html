                <p class="text-black">Mercurana is a genus of arboreal frogs belonging to the family Rhacophoridae. The genus was
                    named from the only known species Mercurana myristicapalustris, which was described in 2013
                    from the Western Ghats of Kerala, India. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>The generic name was derived from and given as a tribute
                    to Freddie Mercury, the late vocalist of the British rock band Queen, in combination with
                    the Latin name for "frog" (Rana, which is also the name of the most common frog genus). The frog is
                    different from other related frogs in that it has extensively webbed toes, lives only in swampy
                    lowlands, and lays its eggs on mud with which it carefully mixes leaf litter.
                    </p>
                <p>Mercurana are arboreal frogs and live in lowland swamp forest. They breed during the premonsoon. During the breeding season, males call females at sunset while perched on slender trunks
                    of tree saplings, or branches of understorey vegetation, generally 0.25â€“1.5 m above the forest floor,
                    during the intervals when the intermittent rainfall subsided. Different advertisement call types were
                    observed. Sometimes males engage in combat with each other for optimal perching sites.
                    </p>
                <p>The
                    female descends to the male's perch and they engage in axillary amplexus. Then they descend to the
                    forest floor and entered the leaf litter to access the soil substrate below. The female (still in
                    amplexus) used her pointed snout to make a shallow burrow in the soil. She then turns around to
                    position the posterior ends of the pair over the freshly made burrow, and initiates oviposition.</p>
                <p>Mercurana is endemic to India. The monotypic species Mercurana myristicapalustris has been
                    documented only in the western foothills of the Agasthyamalai Hill Range in Kerala. The habitat
                    preference is also strictly the low-elevation of swampy forest (100 to 300 m asl) dominated
                    by Myristica trees.</p>
