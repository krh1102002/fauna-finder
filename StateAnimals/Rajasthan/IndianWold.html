                <p class="text-black">The Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) is a subspecies of grey wolf that ranges from Southwest Asia to the Indian Subcontinent. It is intermediate in size between the Himalayan wolf and the Arabian wolf, and lacks the former's luxuriant winter coat due to it living in warmer conditions</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p>The Indian wolf is similar in structure to the Eurasian wolf, but is smaller, more slightly built, and has shorter fur with little to no underfur.[6] It is typically around 57–72 cm (22–28 in) at shoulder height, with males ranging from 19 to 25 kg (42-55 lb) and females 17–22 kg (37-49 lb) in weight. Its length ranges from 103 to 145 cm (41–57 in) from nose to tail.[22] Like the Arabian wolf, it has short, thin fur in summer, though the hair on the back remains long even in summer, an adaptation thought to be against solar radiation.[23] The fur is generally greyish-red to reddish-white with grey tones. The hairs are grizzled with black, particularly on the back, which sports a dark V-shaped patch around the shoulders. The limbs are paler than the body, and the underparts are almost completely white.[5] Pups are born sooty-brown, with a milk-white patch on the chest that fades with age.[6] Black specimens are rare, but have been recorded in India's Solapur district and two regions of Iran. In the latter country, the mutation was found to be naturally occurring, unlike in North American grey wolves, which have inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs

                <p>Its habits are similar to those of other grey wolf subspecies, though the Indian wolf generally lives in smaller packs rarely exceeding 6-8 individuals, and is relatively less vocal,[6] having rarely been known to howl.[5] Indian wolf vocalization includes howls, howl-barks, whimper, social squeals, and whines with howls an average fundamental frequency of 422 Hz and whines 906 Hz.[26] There is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary.[27] It tends to breed from mid-October to late December, and whelp in holes or ravines.[5] It typically preys on antelopes, rodents, and hares.[28] It usually hunts in pairs when targeting antelopes, with one wolf acting as a decoy while the other attacks from behind.[6] The range of the Indian wolf overlaps with the golden jackal, sloth bear, leopard, Bengal fox, brown bear, Asiatic lion and Bengal tiger.</p>
