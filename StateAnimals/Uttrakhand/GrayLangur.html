                <p class="text-black">Gray langurs, also called Hanuman langurs and Hanuman monkeys, are Old World monkeys native to the Indian subcontinent constituting the genus Semnopithecus.[1] Traditionally only one species Semnopithecus entellus was recognized, but since about 2001, additional species have been recognized. </p>

                <p>The taxonomy has been in flux, but currently eight species are recognized.
                    Gray langurs are fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 m (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.
                    These langurs are largely gray (some more yellowish), with a black face and ears. Externally, the various species mainly differ in the darkness of the hands and feet, the overall color and the presence or absence of a crest.[4][5] Typically all north Indian gray langurs have their tail tips looping towards their head during a casual walk whereas all south Indian and Sri Lankan gray langurs have an inverted "U" shape or a "S" tail carriage pattern.[6] There are also significant variations in the size depending on the sex, with the male always larger than the female. The head-and-body length is from 51 to 79 cm (20 to 31 in). </p>
                <p>Their tails, at 69 to 102 cm (27 to 40 in) are always longer than their bodies.[7] Langurs from the southern part of their range are smaller than those from the north. At 26.5 kg (58 lb), the heaviest langur ever recorded was a male Nepal gray langur.[5] The larger gray langurs are rivals for the largest species of monkey found in Asia. The average weight of gray langurs is 18 kg (40 lb) in the males and 11 kg (24 lb) in the females.[7]
                    Langurs mostly walk quadrupedally and spend half their time on the ground and the other half in the trees. They will also make bipedal hops, climbing and descending supports with the body upright, and leaps. Langurs can leap 3.6–4.7 m (12–15 ft) horizontally and 10.7–12.2 m (35–40 ft) in descending.
                </p>
                <p>The entire distribution of all gray langur species stretches from the Himalayas in the north to Sri Lanka in the south, and from Bangladesh in the east to Pakistan in the west.[20] They possibly occur in Afghanistan.[5] The bulk of the gray langur distribution is within India, and all seven currently recognized species have at least a part of their range in this country.[4]
                    Gray langurs can adapt to a variety of habitats.[21] They inhabit arid habitats like deserts, tropical habitats like tropical rainforests and temperate habitats like coniferous forests, deciduous habitats and mountains habitats. They are found at sea level to altitudes up to 4,000 m (13,000 ft).[2][3] They can adapt well to human settlements, and are found in villages, towns and areas with housing or agriculture.[22] They live in densely populated cities like Jodhpur, which has a population numbering up to a million.
                </p>
                <p>Gray langurs are diurnal. They sleep during the night in trees but also on man-made structures like towers and electric poles when in human settlements.[24] When resting in trees, they generally prefer the highest branches.[25]
                    Ungulates like bovine and deer will eat food dropped by foraging langurs.[26] Langurs are preyed upon by leopards, dholes and tigers.[27] Wolves, jackals, Asian black bears and pythons may also prey on langurs.
