                <p class="text-black">The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), also known as the Asiatic elephant, is the only
                    living species of the genus Elephas and is distributed throughout the Indian
                    subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India in the west, Nepal in the north, Sumatra in the south,
                    and to Borneo in the east</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>Three subspecies are recognised—E. m. maximus from Sri Lanka, E. m.
                    indicus from mainland Asia and E. m. sumatranus from the island of Sumatra.
                    [1] It is one of only three
                    living species of elephants or elephantids anywhere in the world, the others being the African bush
                    elephant and African forest elephant.
                    The Asian elephant is the largest living land animal in Asia.
                    [5] Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been
                    listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as the population has declined by at least 50 percent over
                    the last three elephant generations, which is about 60–75 years. It is primarily threatened by loss of
                    habitat, habitat degradation, fragmentation and poaching.
                    [3] In 2019, the wild population was
                    estimated at 48,323-51,680 individuals.[6] Female captive elephants have lived beyond 60 years
                    when kept in semi-natural surroundings, such as forest camps. In zoos, Asian elephants die at a
                    much younger age; captive populations are declining due to a low birth and high death rate
                    </p>
                <p>The genus Elephas originated in Sub-Saharan Africa during the Pliocene and spread throughout
                    Africa before expanding into the southern half of Asia.[2] The earliest indications of captive use of
                    Asian elephants are engravings on seals of the Indus Valley civilisation dated to the 3rd millennium
                    BC.</p>
                <p>In general, the Asian elephant is smaller than the African bush elephant and has the highest body
                    point on the head. The back is convex or level. The ears are small with dorsal borders folded
                    laterally. It has up to 20 pairs of ribs and 34 caudal vertebrae. The feet have more nail-like structures
                    than those of African elephants—five on each forefoot, and four on each hind foot.[5] The forehead
                    has two hemispherical bulges, unlike the flat front of the African elephants.
