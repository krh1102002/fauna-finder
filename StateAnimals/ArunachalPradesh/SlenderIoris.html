                <p class="text-black">The slender lorises (Loris) are a genus of loris native to India and Sri Lanka. The genus comprises two species, the red slender loris found in Sri Lanka and the gray slender loris from Sri Lanka and India. </p>

                <p>Slender lorises spend most of their life in trees, traveling along the tops of branches with slow and precise movements. They are found in tropical rainforests, scrub forests, semi-deciduous forests, and swamps. The primates have lifespans of approximately 15 years and are nocturnal. Slender lorises generally feed on insects, reptiles, plant shoots, and fruit. 
                    </p>
                <p>Female slender lorises generally have an exclusive home range while males may overlap with others. They often form small social groups to sleep, containing adults of both sexes as well as the young. The groups also undertake mutual grooming and play wrestling. The adults typically hunt separately during the night. Males will follow females while they are in oestrus and mating may occur after a bout of play fighting. Gray slender lorises will often bear twins but the survival rate is low. Newborn infants cling to the mother's front for a few weeks and after that will be "parked" in a tree while the mother goes off to feed. </p>
