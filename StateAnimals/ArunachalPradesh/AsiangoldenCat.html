                <p class="text-black">The Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) is a medium-sized wild cat native to the
                    northeastern Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and China. It has been listed as Near
                    Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2008,</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p>The Asian golden cat's scientific name honours Coenraad Jacob Temminck and is also
                    called Temminck's cat and Asiatic golden cat. Asian golden cats are territorial and solitary. Previous
                    observations suggested that they are primarily nocturnal, but a field study on two radiocollared specimens revealed arrhythmic activity patterns dominated
                    by crepuscular and diurnal activity peaks, with much less activity late at night. In the study, the
                    male's territory was 47.7 km2
                    (18.4 sq mi) in size and increased by more than 15% during the rainy
                    season. The female's territory was 32.6 km2
                    (12.6 sq mi) in size. Both cats traveled between only
                    55 m (180 ft) to more than 9 km (5.6 mi) in a day, and were more active in July than in March. Asian
                    golden cats recorded in northeast India were active during the day with activity peaks around noon
                    </p>
                <p> Asian golden cats can climb trees when necessary. They hunt birds, hares, rodents, reptiles, and
                    small ungulates such as muntjacs and young sambar deer. They are capable of bringing down prey
                    much larger than themselves, such as domestic water buffalo calves. In the mountains of Sikkim,
                    Asian golden cats reportedly prey on ghoral.
                    Captive Asian golden cats kill small prey with the nape bite typical of cats. They also pluck birds
                    larger than pigeons before beginning to feed. Their vocalizations include hissing, spitting, meowing,
                    purring, growling, and gurgling. Other methods of communication observed in captive Asian golden
                    cats include scent marking, urine spraying, raking trees and logs with claws, and rubbing of the head
                    against various objects â€“ much like a domestic cat</p>
