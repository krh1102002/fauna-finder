                <p class="text-black">The marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata) is a small wild cat native from the eastern
                    Himalayas to Southeast Asia, where it inhabits forests up to an elevation of 2,500 m (8,200 ft). As it
                    is present in a large range, it has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2015.</p>

                <p>The marbled cat is closely related to the Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) and the bay cat (C.
                    badia), all of which diverged from other felids about 9.4 million years ago. The marbled cat is similar in size to a domestic cat, but has rounded ears and a very long tail that is
                    as long as the cat's head and body. The ground colour of its long fur varies from brownish-grey to
                    ochreous brown above and greyish to buff below. It is patterned with black stripes on the short and
                    round head, on the neck and back. On the tail, limbs and underbelly it has solid spots. 
                    </p>
                <p> On the flanks
                    it has irregular dark-edged blotches that fuse to dark areas and look like a 'marbled' pattern. Its paws
                    are webbed between the digits and are completely sheathed. Its coat is thick and soft. Spots on the
                    forehead and crown merge into narrow longitudinal stripes on the neck, and irregular stripes on the
                    back. The legs and underparts are patterned with black dots, and the tail is marked with black spots
                    proximally and rings distally. It has large feet and unusually large canine teeth, resembling those of
                    the big cats, although these appear to be the result of parallel evolution. Marbled cats range from 45
                    to 62 cm (18 to 24 in) in head-body length with a 35 to 55 cm (14 to 22 in) long and thickly furred tail
                    that indicates the cat's adaptation to an arboreal lifestyle, where the tail is used as a counterbalance.
                    Recorded weights vary between 2 and 5 kg (4.4 and 11.0 lb).</p>
