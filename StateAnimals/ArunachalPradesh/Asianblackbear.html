                    bear and white-chested bear, is a medium-sized bear species native to Asia that is largely adapted to
                    an arboreal lifestyle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>It lives in the Himalayas, southeastern Iran, the northern parts of the Indian
                    subcontinent, the Korean Peninsula, China, the Russian Far East, the islands
                    of Honshū and Shikoku in Japan, and Taiwan. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and is
                    threatened by deforestation and poaching for its body parts, which are used in traditional medicine.
                    </p>
                <p>The Asian black bear has black fur, a light brown muzzle, and a distinct white patch on the chest,
                    which is sometimes V-shaped.[4] Its ears are bell shaped, proportionately longer than those of other
                    bears, and stick out sideways from the head. Its tail is short, around 11 cm (4.3 in) long.[5] Adults
                    measure 70–100 cm (28–39 in) at the shoulder, and 120–190 cm (47–75 in) in length. Adult males
                    weigh 60–200 kg (130–440 lb) with an average weight of about 135 kg (298 lb). Adult females weigh
                    40–125 kg (88–276 lb), and large ones up to 140 kg (310 lb).</p>
