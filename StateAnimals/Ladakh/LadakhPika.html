                <p class="text-black">The Ladak pika (Ochotona ladacensis), also known as the Ladakh pika,[2] is a species of mammal in the family Ochotonidae found in China, India, and Pakistan. Prior to identification as a separate species, specimens were thought to be of the plateau pika. Named for the Ladakh region, they are commonly found in valleys of the mountain ranges spanning from Pakistan through India to China at an elevation between 4,300 and 5,450 m (14,110 and 17,880 ft) and are herbivores</p>

                <p>The fur of the Ladak pika is a light brown/grey with a yellow/white underside.[3] The length of the body of an adult specimen measures between 7 and 9 inches (18 and 23 cm).[4] The outside areas of the ears are a color reminiscent of rust. The skull has a high arch.[3] They reproduce during late June and early July.</p>
                <p>The Ladak pika is found in the mountain ranges of northern India, northeastern Pakistan, and western China including the provinces of Qinghai, Xizang and Xinjiang, as well as across the Tibetan Plateau.[1][3] They inhabit valleys at elevations between 4,300 and 5,450 metres (14,110 and 17,880 ft),[3] and dig burrows.[1] They are herbivorous and are thought to eat roots throughout the winter such as those of the family Primulaceae.[1][3] The Ladak pika lives in territorial family groups.[5] They have been recorded as being commonly found during surveys in these regions.</p>
