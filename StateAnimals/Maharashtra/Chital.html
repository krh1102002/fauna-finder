                <p class="text-black">In 1812, Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and
                    established the name Catarrhini, "Old World monkeys", ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in French).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>The extant sister of the Catarrhini in the monkey ("singes") group is the Platyrrhini (New World
                    monkeys).Some nine million years before the bifurcation between the Cercopithecidae and the
                    apes, the Platyrrhini emerged within "monkeys" by migration to South America from Afro-Arabia
                    (the Old World),[citation needed] likely by ocean.
                    The apes are thus deep in the tree of extant
                    and extinct monkeys, and any of the apes is distinctly closer related to the Cercopithecidae
                    than the Platyrrhini are.
                    The chital (Axis axis; /tʃiːtəl/), also known as spotted deer, chital deer, and axis deer, is a deer species native to the Indian subcontinent. It was first described and given a binomial name by German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. A moderate-sized deer, male chital reach nearly 90 cm (35 in) and females 70 cm (28 in) at the shoulder. While males weigh 30–75 kg (66–165 lb), the lighter females weigh 25–45 kg (55–99 lb). It is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and antlers are present only on males. The upper parts are golden to rufous, completely covered in white spots. The abdomen, rump, throat, insides of legs, ears, and tail are all white. The antlers, three-pronged, are nearly 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long.</p>
                <p>The vernacular name "chital" (pronounced /tʃiːtəl/)[4] comes from cītal (Hindi: चीतल), derived from the Sanskrit word citrala (चित्रल), meaning "variegated" or "spotted".[5] The name of the cheetah has a similar origin.[6] Variations of "chital" include "cheetal" and "cheetul".[7] Other common names for the chital are Indian spotted deer (or simply the spotted deer) and axis deer..</p>
