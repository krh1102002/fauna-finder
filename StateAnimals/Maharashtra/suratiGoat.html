                <p class="text-black">Aenigmachanna gollum, the Gollum snakehead, is a species of aquifer-dwelling dragon snakehead
                    fish that is endemic to the Indian state of Kerala.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>A. gollum has an elongated, eel-like body coloured mostly brown and beige. Its fins are long
                    and transparent, with the dorsal fin stretching for about three-quarters of its body length, and
                    the anal fin stretching for more than half its body length. Its pectoral fin is large, while the pelvic
                    fin is absent. Its tailfin is ovoid. Several large scales cover the top of the head. It has a reduced swim
                    bladder.</p>
                <p>Unlike many stygofauna - which usually have reduced colouring and have poor or no vision - A.
                    gollum has well-developed pigmentation and normally-sized eyes.</p>
                <p>Due to its reduced swim bladder, A. gollum cannot remain buoyant in water. Like other snakehead
                    fishes, it breathes air. It moves by undulating its fins, like an eel.</p>
