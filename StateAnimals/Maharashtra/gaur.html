                <p>The gaur (Bos gaurus; /ɡaʊər/), also known as the Indian bison, is a bovine native to South and Southeast Asia, and has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1986. The global population was estimated at a maximum of 21,000 mature individuals in 2016. It has declined by more than 70% during the last three generations, and is extirpated from Sri Lanka and most likely Bangladesh. Populations in well-protected areas are stable and increasing.</p>
                <p> It is the largest species among the wild cattle and the Bovidae. In Malaysia, it is called seladang, and pyaung in Myanmar.[2] The domesticated form of the gaur is called gayal (Bos frontalis) or mithun.</p>
                <p>Due to its reduced swim bladder, A. gollum cannot remain buoyant in water. Like other snakehead
                    fishes, it breathes air. It moves by undulating its fins, like an eel.</p>
