                <p>Chevrotains, or mouse-deer, are small even-toed ungulates that make up the family Tragulidae, the
                    only extant members of the infraorder Tragulina. The 10 extant species are placed in three
                    genera,[1][2] but several species also are known only from fossils.[3] The extant species are found
                    in forests in South and Southeast Asia, with a single species, the water chevrotain, in the
                    rainforests of Central and West Africa.[4] They are solitary or live in pairs, and feed almost
                    exclusively on plant material.[4] Chevrotains are the smallest hoofed mammals in the world. The
                    Asian species weigh between 0.7 and 8.0 kg (1.5 and 17.6 lb), while the African chevrotain is
                    considerably larger at 7–16 kg (15–35 lb).[5] With an average length of 45 cm (18 in) and an average
                    height of 30 cm (12 in), the Java mouse-deer is the smallest extant (living) ungulate or hoofed
                    mammal, as well as the smallest extant even-toed ungulate.[6]

                <p>The word "chevrotain" comes from the French word chevrot (kid or fawn), derived from the Middle
                    French chèvre (goat).[10]

                    The single African species is consistently known as "chevrotain".[1][4][11] The names "chevrotain"
                    and "mouse-deer" have been used interchangeably among the Asian species,[4][12][13][14] though
                    recent authorities typically have preferred chevrotain for the species in the genus Moschiola and
                    mouse-deer for the species in the genus Tragulus.[1] Consequently, all species with pale-spotted or
                    -striped upper parts are known as "chevrotain" and without are known as "mouse-deer".

                    The Telugu name for the Indian spotted chevrotain is jarini pandi, which literally means "a deer and
                    a pig".[citation needed] In Kannada, it is called barka (ಬರ್ಕ), in Malayalam, it is called കൂരമാൻ
                    kūramān, and the Konkani name for it is barinka. The Tamil term is சருகு மான் sarukumāṉ "leaf-pile
                    deer". The Sinhala name meeminna roughly translates to "mouse-like deer". This was used in the
                    scientific name of the Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain, M. meminna</p>
